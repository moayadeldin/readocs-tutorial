Welcome to Deeptune's documentation!
===================================

**DeepTune** is a full compatible library to automate Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing, state-of-the-art algorithms on diverse images and text datasets. The library is designed for use in different applied machine learning domains, including but not limited to medical imaging, and natural language understanding, providing users with powerful, ready-to-use CLI tool that unlock the full potential of their case studies through just a few simple commands.

Check out the :doc:`guides/install` section for further information, including how to install the library.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

Main Features
-------------

- Fine-tuning state-of-the-art Computer Vision algorithms (ResNet, DenseNet, etc.) for image classification.
- Fine-tuning state-of-the-art NLP (BERT, GPT-2) algorithms for text classification.
- End-to-end training for tabular and time-series algorithms (time-series is temporarily disabled; scheduled for re-release soon).
- Enabled parameter-efficient fine-tuning of state-of-the-art vision and NLP models using PEFT with LoRA, reducing computational cost while maintaining high performance.
- Leveraged fine-tuned and pretrained state-of-the-art vision and language models to generate robust knowledge representations for downstream visual and textual tasks.
